# ThaiDLT

A Telegram-first driving-theory learning product. Product scope and engineering
workflow are recorded in `.agent/`; read `AGENTS.md` before contributing.

## Developer setup

Install Node.js 24 LTS and pnpm 11.19.0 (the version pinned in `package.json`).
If pnpm is not installed, run `npm install --global pnpm@11.19.0`.

From the repository root:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm check
```

Use `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` for reproducible installs in automated checks.
No database, credentials, or external services are needed for this foundation.

The root currently runs ESLint, a strict TypeScript check of the repository tests,
and a Vitest sanity test. Workspace packages will live in `apps/*` and
`packages/*` as their tasks require them; no application is implemented yet.
New TypeScript packages should extend `tsconfig.base.json` and connect their
checks to the root scripts when introduced.

## Quality gates and formatting

`pnpm check` runs lint, typecheck, then tests in that order. It stops on the
first failure and returns a nonzero exit status. Each gate can also run alone.
Tests run once (no watch mode). Use the pinned pnpm version and frozen lockfile
in CI to run the same checks as local development.

Use two-space indentation, single quotes and semicolons in TypeScript and
JavaScript, trailing commas in multiline lists, and a final newline. JSON uses
double quotes and no trailing commas. Keep Markdown readable in source and
avoid unrelated formatting changes. This is a documented review policy;
ESLint checks code correctness and does not enforce all formatting choices.

To verify failure propagation safely, create only one temporary probe below
under `tests/` at a time, run `pnpm check`, and confirm a nonzero exit code.
Remove each probe before creating the next, then confirm `pnpm check` passes.
Never commit the probes.

| Probe filename | File contents | Expected failing gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gate-probe.ts` | `export const probe: any = 1;` | lint (`no-explicit-any`) |
| `gate-probe.ts` | `export const probe: string = 1;` | typecheck (lint passes) |
| `gate-probe.test.ts` | `import { expect, it } from 'vitest'; it('probe', () => { expect(1).toBe(2); });` | test (lint and typecheck pass) |

Inspect `$LASTEXITCODE` in PowerShell or `$?` in a POSIX shell immediately after
the command. The output should show that gates after the failure did not run.
